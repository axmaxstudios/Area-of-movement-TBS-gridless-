# Area-of-movement-TBS-gridless-Unity
A simple visualization of the possible path of a Navmesh Agent inside Unity

By now it's an aproximation of the currently available area around a target navMesh agent

Add these two cripts on an object (maybe the camera gameObject) and add a NavMesh Agent to the PathCalculator from the editor. You can even tweak the circle rendering result from the Inspector
